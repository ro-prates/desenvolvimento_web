- refactoring: course, module, and lecture should be container with parts
  - A course is a container of modules
  - A module is a container of lectures
  - A lecture is a container of further materials

- refactoring the above refactoring
  - use composition instead of inheritance
    - A course contains a container of modules ...
      -> Delegate calls

- handle exceptional cases:
  -> adding an existing module/lecture/material
  -> removing an unexisting module/lecture/material
  -> determining the position of an unexisting module/lecture/material
  -> moving module/lecture/material to invalid position
  -> moving unexisting module/lecture/material

- should be able to remove modules from courses
- should be able to rename modules/lectures
- should be able to add modules/lectures in a specific position
- should be able to track progress of user in an enrolled course (watched lectures?)
- should be able to have a current lecture in enrollment
